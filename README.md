# blackjack
Simple blackjack engine and command line implementation. Also features bot that can play by calculating probabilites. For how to run or test the program view the user guide in the docs folder.

Blackjack (a.k.a. 21) is a card game. It relies only on the value of the card and not the suit. This implementation of blackjack uses integers as cards. Many variants of blackjack exist with slightly different rules. For the rules used in this implementation, refer to the rulebook.txt file in the docs folder.

This blackjack game requires exactly 2 players. There are 2 types of players : Human players (who can enter input) and bots (who calculate probability and return a decision when called to make a turn).
